# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously and value the contributions of security researchers and users in identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities. If you discover a security vulnerability in our project, we encourage you to report it to us promptly.

To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

**Submit a Report:** raise a ticket via Github Issues. Please include the following information:

- Description of the vulnerability, including the affected component(s) and potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
- Any additional information or context that may be helpful in understanding or reproducing the issue.

**Response Time:** Upon receiving your report, we will acknowledge it promptly and investigate the issue. We aim to respond to all reports within 72 hours, though response times may vary depending on the complexity of the vulnerability.

**Disclosure and Resolution:** Once the vulnerability has been confirmed, we will work to address it promptly. We may request further information or assistance from you during this process. Once the vulnerability has been resolved, we will disclose it publicly, providing credit to the reporter if desired.

**Coordinated Disclosure:** We follow a coordinated disclosure process to ensure that security vulnerabilities are addressed responsibly and efficiently. We ask that reporters refrain from disclosing vulnerabilities publicly until we have had sufficient time to address them.

## Scope

This security policy applies to all aspects of the SQL Master Hub project, including but not limited to the source code, documentation, website, and any associated services or infrastructure.

## Responsible Disclosure

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities in accordance with this security policy. We ask that reporters refrain from exploiting or conducting further research on vulnerabilities beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the issue.

Thank you for helping to keep SQL Master Hub secure!
