# SQL Master Hub

## About
This is a project built for sql enthusiasts in need of a place where they can practice sql safely.

## Getting Started
At the moment I'm facing issues finding a reliable database provider in order to allow users to play with the practice area. The workaround found at the moment is to create a local MySQL server and connect it with this project with the help of mysql2

## Next Steps
This project is in continuous development and is planning to be released as a free sql playground for learners.
